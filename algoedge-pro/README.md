## Quick Start (Docker Compose)
1. Copy env file and set secrets
```
cp .env.example .env
```
2. Build and start
```
docker compose up --build
```
- API: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Web: http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- Data connectors currently include basic implementations; you will need API keys for live data and execution
- Some features ship as stubs to enable rapid iteration (e.g., ICT structures, MT4/5)
- Optimizer uses a simple random/grid search initially; can be upgraded to Optuna/Nevergrad
- Strategy DSL enables versioned, portable strategies between UI and engine

## Monetization
- SaaS subscriptions (tiers by strategy slots & data access)
- Marketplace transaction fees (default 20%)

## Security & Compliance
- API keys and credentials are never stored in code. Use environment variables or a secrets manager
- Respect broker/exchange terms and paper-trade before live trading
